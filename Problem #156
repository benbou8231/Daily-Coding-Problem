Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
This problem was asked by Facebook.
Given a positive integer n, find the smallest number of squared integers which sum to n.
For example, given n = 13, return 2 since 13 = 3² + 2² = 9 + 4.
Given n = 27, return 3 since 27 = 3² + 3² + 3² = 9 + 9 + 9.
